## Abstract
This report describes the functionality of the HTML parser. As the data is
the fundament of all the analysis I keep a close look at the process which
collects all the data. kicker.de and transfermarkt.de have a continuous
change in the HTML structure of their sites, so the parsers have to be 
continously adapted, to ensure consistent and correct information.

# Kicker data

Kicker provides information about games, players and player performances.

## Kader collector

Creates teams, Kader and players. Input: saisons and liga.

## Spiele collector

Can create teams as well. 
TODO


# Transfermarkt data

Mainly assigns prices to players. Also assigns positions to players and games,
because kicker just has positions for players independent of games.
